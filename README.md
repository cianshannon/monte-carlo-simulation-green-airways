# Green Airways Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation model developed for Green Airways to forecast and analyse an [overbooking strategy]. The model is built using Excel and is designed to simulate an overbooking strategy of [5 customers over plane capacity].The simulation looks to analyse the [profit per flight] when encountering [no shows], and [over booking] resulting in [bumped pasengers]. The simulation model is simulated over a [500 day period].

## Getting Started

These instructions and details for the simulation can be found on the [Project Details] sheet.

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation model, you will need:

- Microsoft Excel 

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open the `Simulation Model - Green Airways.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.
