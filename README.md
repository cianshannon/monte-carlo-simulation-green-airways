# Green Airways Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation model developed for Green Airways to forecast and analyse an **overbooking strategy**. The model is built using Excel and is designed to simulate an overbooking strategy of **5 customers over plane capacity**. The simulation looks to analyse the **profit per flight** when encountering **no shows**, and **over booking** resulting in **bumped passengers**. The simulation model is simulated over a **500-day period**.

## Getting Started

**Some introductory information on the model:**
Green Airways has **3 flights from Dublin to London each day** (apart from Dec 25th)

The number of **no-shows** and **estimated Passenger Demand** for each flight over the past 12 months is given in ***Data Sheet A***. 

Each flight has a maximum capacity of **100 passengers**.

The company estimates that the **average profit per customer is €40** and the **average cost of overbooking a passenger is €100**. We assume both of these parameters are fixed for all passengers on all flights.

We assume all no-show passengers lose their booking and do not need to be accommodated on future flights.

The rest of the instructions and details for the simulation can be found on the **Project Details** sheet.

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation model, you will need:

- Microsoft Excel 

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open the `Simulation Model - Green Airways.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.
